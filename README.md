# IELTS Course Product Page â€” 10MS FE TASK

This project is a **Next.js** application developed for the **Frontend Engineer (Level 1)** assessment. The task was to design and develop a product page similar to the [IELTS Course by Munzereen Shahid](https://10minuteschool.com/product/ielts-course/) using **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and SSR/ISR functionalities.

The application fetches real-time product data from the **10 Minute School Public API** and renders a well-structured product landing page with reusable components and optimized performance.
